I"3<p>Moving data from one place to another is one of the most important functions in today‚Äôs ever connected society. For years, programmers used simple text files or comma separated values to translate data from one program or computer to another. These were not necessarily ‚Äúhuman-readable‚Äù and if they were provided in binary format, you‚Äôd need a specific program to view or edit. How do we translate data in a structured format that is ‚Äúhuman-readable‚Äù and potentially self-validating?</p>

<h2 id="here-comes-xml-a-brief-history">Here comes XML, a brief history</h2>
<p>In 1970 Charles Goldfarb, Ed Mosher &amp; Ray Lorie invented GML, a way of marking up documents with ‚Äústructural tags‚Äù. These tags helped enhance text editing with formatting, and allow for information retrieval systems to work well with the documents they created. GML stood for their initials but they soon coined the term ‚Äúmark-up language‚Äù and GML soon became Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) adopted by ISO and ANSI standards in 1986. One item to note is that SGML is not a markup language, but a way of defining a markup language.</p>

<p>At about the same time as SGML came HTML. The purpose of HTML, and the World Wide Web was so employees across the globe could share and update information for each other to see. Originally developed solely for a singular platform, the creator Tim Berners-Lee put the specifications and code for the entire HTML project on the internet, sparking interest throughout the internet community. HTML was quickly adopted as the advent of the internet loomed. As web grew more and more, more online documents were being produced, and various implementations of HTML grew, but no standardized set of HTML tags appeared.</p>

<p>HTML evolved to become only useful for presentation layers and not data descriptions, transfers, or anything inbetween. It was believed that HTML was limited. Due to the overarching complexity of SGML, XML, eXtensible Markup Language, was born. XML can be described as a ‚Äòmeta markup language‚Äô and its purpose was to simplify SGML by focusing on a particular problem - documents on the internet. ‚ÄòMeta markup language‚Äô allows users to create any tags needed (hence ‚ÄòeXtensible‚Äô) and then describing those tags and their permitted uses. It is a simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices and much more. The best part was it was easily readable by both machines and humans. Once again it is important to note that XML is not a markup language, but a way of defining a markup language.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs give an example of what XML is not. You might have seen plenty of ‚Äòsave as .xml‚Äô options in Microsoft products or other applications. The simple fact of a document being saved in XML format does not guarantee any usefulness or ability to transfer data between applications. For example, you might save a file in XML format from Microsoft Word. These could be large documents with hundreds of Microsoft Word specific elements and attributes. Just because it is XML does not mean that Apple Pages or Adobe Illustrator can open this file, read the contents, and let you begin editing in a native file format. It might be possible for the developer of that software to create an import tool for that specific XML format from that specific application, but without that added functionality there is no ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù interoperability. This is where standardization comes into play and different entities must collaborate.</p>
