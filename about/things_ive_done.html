                Starting in July 2014 I assumed the role of <u>Instrument & Electrical Engineer</u> at Chevron Richmond
                Refinery. I
                have worked throughout the refinery in a variety of functions including supporting daily plant
                operation, plant outage/shutdown activities, emergency break-in work, and capital and expense projects.
                This role primarily focused on the instrumentation and electrical infrastructure in the refinery and the
                work assignments varied in complexity from simple instrument replacement to complete equipment control
                overhaul. The list below highlights some of the major projects I championed:
